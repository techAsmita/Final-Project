# ðŸŒ³ Tree Species Image Classification using CNN

An image classification project aimed at identifying tree species from leaf images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built and trained in Google Colab.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Manual identification of tree species is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. This project aims to automate the process using deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, to classify images of tree leaves into their corresponding species with high accuracy.

## ðŸ’¡ Solution Overview

To address this challenge, we:

- Preprocessed and augmented the dataset of leaf images
- Built a CNN using TensorFlow/Keras
- Trained and validated the model on split data
- Evaluated model performance primarily using accuracy
- Achieved ~90% test accuracy, ensuring the model is reliable for classification tasks
